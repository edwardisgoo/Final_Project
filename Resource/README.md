# Resource Files

This folder contains level text files used by the game.
Each level file is a grid of digits where each digit
represents a tile ID.

Digit mapping:

- `0` : Air tile (non-solid background)
- `1` : Ground tile (solid surface)
- `2` : Spike tile (fatal obstacle)

Every level file currently uses 15 rows and 100 columns.
